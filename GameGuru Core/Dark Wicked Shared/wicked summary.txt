Summary
-------

The WICKED ENGINE repo is cloned to sit outside the main GAMEGURUV3REPO repo, called WICKEDREPO and pulls from the TGC FORKED Wicked Engine on GitHub.

This ensures the latest version of the source code can be pulled to the fork and applied for instant recompiling against.

Only the 'template_Windows' project was taken and extensively modified as the new foundation for GameGuru MAX. Renamed 'Wicked-MAX' project.

A new 'GameGuruWickedMAX.sln' solution was created to host the building up of the new 64-bit foundation, and keeps the old projects in the solution for easier cut/paste and in some cases re-using modules that have either insufficient or absent functionality in the Wicked SDK.

Using DW as the prefix for all new modules that map onto the Wicked Engine (as opposed to the old DBP engine)

APR29TH - Having completed text cleanup, the BEST way is to keep a single LIB folder, and the main module header using the WICKEDENGINE define to point to the separated functions that need to be abstracted, but can leave a core set of functions and data structures that are common to both in a common header/source file set(s). We want as little code duplication as possible to save integration time, reduce bug fixing time and produce a smaller cleaner, easier to navigate result.

 - STAGE 1 : Clean up Module, separate into CORE and GRAPHIC-ENGINE-DEPENDENT header and code
 - STAGE 2 : Get DBP side compiling against
 - STAGE 3 : Get new WICKED ENGINE side up and running
  (after first stage, should still be able to switch back to DBP, rebuild and run to ensure software has not been messed up)
 
MAY23RD - Rebuilt all DBP LIBs in 64-bit (mostly as is) so can get main executable compiling (needed pretty much all of them).
